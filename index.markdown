I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics
at Lafayette College in Easton, PA.

My research areas include geometric group theory,
combinatorics, and topology, and I am especially interested in the braid
group and its many appearances throughout mathematics.

I believe in [Federico Ardila](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/)'s axioms from
[Todos Cuentan: Cultivating Diversity in Combinatorics](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):
1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

Outside of mathematics, my hobbies include Aikido, music, and games.
